Decyphertek Read The Docs
===============================================

Open source technologies can be time consuming to research and difficult to implement. 
We do the research and boil down the notes , so that its easy to understand and use. We
provide instructions for AWS Marketplace customers as well as technical notes on open source
projects. These notes can be used for Enterprise, educational purposes, or DIY projects.
