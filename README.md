Decyphertek Read The Docs
==========================

Open source technologies can be time consuming to research and difficult to implement. 
We do the research and boil down the notes , so that its easy to understand and use. We
provide instructions for AWS Marketplace, GCP Marketplace, and Azure Marketplace
customers.We also provide technical notes on open source projects. These notes can be 
used for Enterprise, educational purposes, or DIY projects.
