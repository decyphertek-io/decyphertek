"Qigong is a system of coordinated body-posture and movement, breathing, and meditation used for the purposes of health, spirituality, and martial-arts training. With roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy, and martial arts, qigong is traditionally viewed by the Chinese and throughout Asia as a practice to cultivate and balance qi, translated as "life energy"" [Wikipedia-Qigong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong 'Wikipedia-Qigong')
