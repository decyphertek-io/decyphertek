"Qigong (/ˈtʃiːˈɡɒŋ/),[1] qi gong, chi kung, chi 'ung, or chi gung (simplified Chinese: 气功; traditional Chinese: 氣功; pinyin: qìgōng; Wade–Giles: ch‘i kung; lit.'life-energy cultivation') is a system of coordinated body-posture and movement, breathing, and meditation[2] used for the purposes of health, spirituality, and martial-arts training.[3] With roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy, and martial arts, qigong is traditionally viewed by the Chinese and throughout Asia as a practice to cultivate and balance qi (pronounced approximately as "chee"), translated as "life energy".[4]" [Wikipedia-Qigong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong 'Wikipedia-Qigong')
