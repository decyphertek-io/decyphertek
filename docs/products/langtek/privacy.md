# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 18, 2024

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

At Langtek, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains our approach to data collection and usage.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data or user information.**

Langtek is designed with privacy as a core principle. This means:

- **No personal information collection** - We don't collect names, emails, or any identifying data
- **No behavior tracking** - We don't monitor how you use the app
- **No server storage** - We don't store any user data on our servers
- **No analytics** - We don't use analytics or tracking tools
- **No cookies** - We don't employ cookies or similar tracking technologies

## Data Selling

**We do not sell any user data.**

Since we don't collect any user data, there is nothing to sell, share, or monetize. Your privacy is not a commodity.

## Local Data

Any data processed by Langtek remains on your device. We have no access to:

- Your conversations
- Your inputs or queries
- Your usage patterns
- Any files or content you interact with

## Third-Party Services

Langtek includes optional features that use third-party services:

### AI Function (OpenRouter AI)

When you use the AI function:

- **Your AI questions and interactions are sent to OpenRouter** - Only what you type into the AI function gets sent to OpenRouter for processing
- **OpenRouter's privacy policy applies** - You can review their privacy policy at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
- **We don't see your AI interactions** - We don't have access to what you send to OpenRouter

### Translation Function (FreeTranslator API)

When you use the translation feature:

- **Articles or sentences are sent to FreeTranslator** - Only the text you choose to translate gets sent to the FreeTranslator API for processing
- **Manual interaction required** - Translations only happen when you actively choose to translate something
- **We don't see your translations** - We don't have access to what you send to FreeTranslator

### Your Choice

Both features are optional. You can use Langtek as an RSS reader without using AI or translation features. If you don't use these features, nothing leaves your device.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
