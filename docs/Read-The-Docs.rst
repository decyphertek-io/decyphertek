  1. place your docs/ folder alongside your Python project. If you are starting a new project, you can adapt the pyproject.toml example configuration.
  2. use your existing project repository or create a new repository on Github, GitLab, Bitbucket or another host supported by Read the Docs
  3. copy .readthedocs.yaml and the docs/ folder into your project.
  4. customize all the files, replacing example contents.
  5. add your own Python project, replacing the pyproject.toml configuration and lumache.py module
  6. rebuild the documenation locally to see that it works.
  7. finally, register your project on Read the Docs, see Importing Your Documentation.
